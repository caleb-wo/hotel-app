# HotelApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.17. It was a part of a Udemy course I enrolled in to learn the basics of Angular. This project simulates a simple hotel reservation tool.

## Angular Tooling Learned & Used

This application exposed me to the following Angular concepts & tools:

- Modules
- @Injectable() services
- @Angular/forms
  - FormGroup, FormBuilder, Validators
- @Angular/router
  - Router, ActivatedRoute
- Bootstrap styling

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
