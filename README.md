# HotelApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.17. It was a part of a Udemy course I enrolled in to learn the basics of Angular. This project simulates a simple hotel reservation tool. It is setup to use a Mockoon mock API. I'm will be adding a .gif demo soon!
